# VPR - SDF

`vprsdf` is a fast signed distance field generator for Node and the browser. It doesn't use any external libraries, which makes it an excellent candidate for use in a separate thread or worker for asynchronous execution.

This package is a port of the beautifully explained [algorithm](https://tkmikyon.medium.com/computing-the-signed-distance-field-a1fa9ba2fc7d) from [@tkmikyon](https://twitter.com/tkmikyon).
